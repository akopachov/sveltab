# Privacy Policy

SvelTab does not store any information about or from you. Your settings are saved securely within your browser and never transmitted to Us.

## Scope

This privacy policy covers the SvelTab browser extension and web version.

## Terms

* SvelTab - The SvelTab browser extension and web version
* We/Us - The developer of SvelTab
* External Service - A service providing content to SvelTab, such as Unsplash

## Data usage

### Settings

Your settings control what SvelTab displays on your dashboard. Your settings are stored securely within your browser. We do not store a copy of your settings.

If you use a background or widget that is powered by an External Service, your settings for that service will be provided to it. For example, if you choose Unsplash with a custom search term for your background, that search term will be sent to Unsplash to retrieve matching images.
